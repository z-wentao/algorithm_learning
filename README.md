### What is this project about?
Record personal Algorithms and Data Structures learning process, which includes:
- Problems
- Thinking Process
which can help me track my thinking process and used for Reflection
- My solution

The roadmap to learn Algorithms & Data Structures.
### Foundamentals:
1. Problem solving skills
<< How to solve it >>
- understad the Problem
- devise a plan
- implement the plan
- reflect the process

2. Asymptotic analysis

### Topic
